# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Using Nueral Networks to determine chaity success with funds provided by Alphabet Soup.

### Data Preprocessing
What variables are considered the target for your model?
Whether the charity is successful or not successful.

What variables are considered to be the features for your model?
APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT

What variable,are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
EIN and NAME columns 

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
I tried a variable amount of input and output layers.  I tried various activation functions to increase performance of the model.  The intial test yielded the greatest accuracy reslult. Although I varied the number of nuerons and layers the intial test showed the greatest accuracy.  For enhanced performance, I wold recommemd testing additonal applications for a more targeted result.
